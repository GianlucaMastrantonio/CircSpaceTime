Description: This package implements spatial, spatio-temporal and temporal models for circular data. 
Currently the following models are implemented:
    Spatial Wrapped Normal
    We are going to update constantly the library with Bayesian and classical models dealing with complex dependence structures for circular, cylindrical and spherical variable.
