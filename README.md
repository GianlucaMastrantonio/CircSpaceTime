# CircSpaceTime
An R package for spatial, spatio-temporal and temporal model for circular, cylindrical and spherical data

This package implements spatial, spatio-temporal and temporal models for circular data.  

Currently the following models are implemented:  
Spatial Wrapped Normal   
Spatial Projected Normal   

We are going to update constantly the library with Bayesian and classical models dealing with complex dependence structures for circular, cylindrical and spherical variable.
